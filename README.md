# Wordnado
Our 3rd iteration (haha) of Wordnado: Eye Escape

# Description
The goal for the user is to escape the tornado by collecting as many letters as they can in a given time limit to form words. In the tornado there are a series of random cloud blocks that a user jumps off to collect random letters which are added to a collection (displayed on screen). Within the tornado, there are random “attacks” on the user that steal 1 letter per attack from the user's collection. As the levels progress, attackers become more frequent in the game. When the timer ends for each level, the user is tasked with creating as many words as they can from their collected letters. Each letter has an assigned numerical point value, so the leaderboard shows the total points earned from the inputted words. The goal for each level is to accumulate as many points as possible.
