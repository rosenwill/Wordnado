# Wordnado
Our 3rd iteration (haha) of Wordnado: Eye Escape

# Description
The goal for the user is to escape the tornado by collecting as many letters as they can in a given time limit to form words. In the tornado there are a series of random cloud blocks that a user jumps off of to get to the next cloud. On randomized blocks, there are randomized letters. When the user lands on each bar (by jumping with the arrow keys), the associated letter is added to their collection of letters. For each level of the game, there is a time limit for the user to collect letters. Within the tornado, there are random “attacks” on the user that steal letters from them. When the monsters/attackers hit the user, they randomly take 1 letter in the user’s collection. As the levels progress, attackers become more frequent in the game. While the user is jumping on the blocks, the user can see all of the letters they have collected so far. When the timer ends for each level, the user is tasked with creating as many words as they can from their collected letters. Each letter has an assigned numerical point value, so the leaderboard shows the total points earned from the inputted words. The goal for each level is to accumulate as many points as possible.
